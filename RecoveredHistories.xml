               <p> In Jamaica <placeName key="Jamaica" ref=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica> </Jamaica> and the other islands the evidence of slaves is still wholly inadmissible, not merely in cases implicating their owners, but in all cases whatsoever, whether civil or criminal, affecting persons of free condition. -Any White men may inflict not only thirty-nine but three hundred and ninety lashes on a slave; he may even murder the slave outright; yet, if the crime be not committed willing to testify against him, he is secure from punishment <interp key="I believe this to be true because in this time black individuals had no rights whatsoever therefore they were owned and merely just property of the whites and their punishments" n="Macauley, Zachary, 1823.

A thousand other slaves may have been present, but not one of the thousand would be permitted to offer his testimony in a court of justice against the criminal.

It is equally so in all civil causes, even when the suit involves a question of personal freedom.</p> <p> It is unnecessary to point out the enormities which must result from such a system. About 345,000 inhabitants of Jamaica <placeName key="Jamaica" ref=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica> </Jamaica> for example, are this shut out, by the operation of the universal principle of colonial law, from any fair hope of obtaining legal redress for any injury, whether civil or criminal, which they may sustain from any one of the privileged order, amounting, perhaps, to a fifteenth or twentieth part of the whole population; while the persons composing that order have this farther pledge of immunity, that it is their common interest to discourage and defeat any attempts, on the part of the the slaves, to obtain the efficient protection of magistrates or of courts of justice. </p> <p> 4. The slaves in Jamaica and other colonies are still regarded by the law, and treated, in point of fact, not as human beings, but as chattels ; and, as such, are liable to be seized and sold for the debts of their master, with as little
