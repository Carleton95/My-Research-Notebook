Information obtained from "Big data for dead people: Digital readings and conundrums of positivism"

Using digital collection as a current tool to collect digital material that forms that basis for most of our current research is composed of the maudlin leavings of rich dead white men. In other words most of the basis of research that we have is that only of the rich white dead man because in history they were the only ones that were allowed to have good ideas that anyone would listen too. People of a different class or race would not have their opinions or voices heard.
