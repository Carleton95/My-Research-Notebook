# Why I Am Taking This Class 

My name is Taylor and I am a third year student at Carleton currently studying Criminology. I am currently planning to graduate following this semester. I am finishing my schooling from my home 6 hours from Ottawa and took this class as an elective that I could do from my computer if I am being honest.

I hope this class helps me achieve... 
    
  - Confidence using the internet to display my thoughts and ideas
  - My goals to have a successful online blog
  - A good grade in the class
  - A better sence of how the internet works

I am pretty familiar with the internet and have a small amount of digital experience.  I have developed two websites [Choice Auto Body](http://www.choice-auto-body.ca), [Primrose Park](http://www.primroseparkcamping.com/Pages/default.aspx) for various businesses in my community and I am always looking to improve my skills. 

As I always say...


> You can never learn to much!

I wish to gain the most experience with using the internet and computer for as many things as possible. We live in a society where absolutely *EVERYTHING* is controlled or involves the internet and the more I can know and learn about it the more successful I will become. I hope this course will help me with this!

Even this course is all done online and the majority of other courses at Carleton involve some type of electronic component by using [CuLearn](https://carleton.ca/culearn/) or Carletons library resources from home through the [Library's Website](https://library.carleton.ca). Technology is everywhere, without knowing how it works we will fall behind!
