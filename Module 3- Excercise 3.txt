The process of creating an application programming interface has proven to be a challenge for me. But after reading threw my classmates comments and various problems they had I did not feel alone. But in this module I found the concept of automated downloading to be extremely helpful! The idea that one can save a variety of different information to your computer from an online source could save people tonnes of time. To be able to save them to your computer and to be able to make your own searches to utilize the sources when ever you see fit without having to continuously look up the page is truly a game changer. By using terminal with the collaboration of Wget performing searches will never be the same for me. By learning and continuing to study the various commands the process will become easier and easier. As well as the process of backing them up to ensure they will not be lost by simply altering your command. By being able to create a folder to organize these sources and navigate through them it is being proven that technology is here to assist our lives and by getting a grasp on it, it is becoming nothing but an asset.
