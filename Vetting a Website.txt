What makes you believe this site is a trustworthy provider of historical texts?
	I believe this is a trustworthy site because it is hosted by a group that would have this type of information and their contact information is available if any concerns arise. They also have links to educational resources and tests to test your knowledge on the material. As well this page is funded, only pages that are trustworthy tend to be funded by operations such as the heritage lottery.
